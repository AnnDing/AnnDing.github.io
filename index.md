I am a fourth-year Ph.D student at the department of computer science, the University of Chicago. I am working with [Prof. Kevin Gimpel](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/) on Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Prior to that, My research was mainly focused on Computer System and Computer Architecture.
