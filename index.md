        I am a fifth-year Ph.D student at the department of computer science, the University of Chicago. I am working with <a href="https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/">Prof. Kevin Gimpel</a> on Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. My research focus on neural model robustness in text classification, controllable text generation, and latent-variable modeling of sentence. Prior to that, My research was mainly focused on Computer System and Computer Architecture.
