I am a final-year Ph.D student at the department of computer science, the University of Chicago. I am working with <a href="https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/">Prof. Kevin Gimpel</a> on Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. My research focuses on neural model robustness in text classification, controllable text generation, and latent-variable modeling of sentence.
